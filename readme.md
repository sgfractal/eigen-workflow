# Hourglass Workflow Orchestration: Unlocking Advanced AVS Capabilities

## Executive Summary

**The Hourglass Workflow Extension transforms EigenLayer AVS development from simple task execution to sophisticated, stateful workflow orchestration—while maintaining full compatibility with existing DevKit tooling.**

This enhancement enables complex, multi-phase operations that require coordination between multiple operators, long-running monitoring, conditional execution, and cross-phase data dependencies. It represents a natural evolution of the Hourglass framework that unlocks entirely new categories of AVS applications.

## The Problem: Simple Tasks Hit a Wall

The current Hourglass framework excels at **simple, atomic task execution**:
- ✅ Submit task → Execute → Return result  
- ✅ Perfect for computational workloads
- ✅ Great developer experience with DevKit

However, many real-world AVS require **complex orchestration patterns**:
- ❌ Multi-phase operations with dependencies
- ❌ Long-running monitoring and periodic updates  
- ❌ Conditional execution based on external events
- ❌ Multi-party coordination requiring consensus
- ❌ Cross-phase data sharing and aggregation

**Example**: A decentralized oracle AVS needs to:
1. **Monitor** price feeds continuously
2. **Coordinate** between operators when deviation detected  
3. **Aggregate** responses using consensus mechanisms
4. **Execute** price updates conditionally
5. **Validate** results across multiple verification phases

This cannot be elegantly expressed as a single task.

## The Solution: WorkflowStateMachine

The **WorkflowStateMachine** extends Hourglass with sophisticated orchestration capabilities while maintaining seamless DevKit integration.

### Five Execution Patterns

| Phase Type | Description | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **IMMEDIATE** | Task-like execution | Data processing, computation |
| **COORDINATION** | Multi-operator consensus | Price oracle agreement, governance |
| **CONTINUOUS** | Ongoing monitoring | Health monitoring, fraud detection |
| **CONDITIONAL** | Event-driven triggers | Liquidation events, threshold breaches |
| **AGGREGATION** | Cross-phase data combination | Results synthesis, multi-source validation |

### Workflow Definition Example

```solidity
PhaseDefinition[] memory phases = [
    PhaseDefinition({
        name: "Price Monitoring",
        phaseType: PhaseType.CONTINUOUS,     // Ongoing monitoring
        timeout: 3600,                      // 1 hour monitoring window  
        dependencies: [],                   // No dependencies
        operatorSetId: 1,                   // Monitoring operators
        consensusThreshold: 0,              // N/A for monitoring
        metadata: abi.encode(300, 12)       // 5min intervals, 12 updates
    }),
    PhaseDefinition({
        name: "Deviation Coordination", 
        phaseType: PhaseType.COORDINATION,  // Multi-party consensus
        timeout: 600,                       // 10 minute coordination
        dependencies: [0],                  // Depends on monitoring
        operatorSetId: 2,                   // Coordination operators  
        consensusThreshold: 6667,           // 66.67% consensus required
        metadata: abi.encode("price_update")
    }),
    PhaseDefinition({
        name: "Price Update Execution",
        phaseType: PhaseType.CONDITIONAL,   // Triggered execution
        timeout: 300,                       // 5 minute execution window
        dependencies: [1],                  // Depends on coordination
        operatorSetId: 3,                   // Execution operators
        triggerCondition: abi.encode(
            TriggerConditionType.PRICE_THRESHOLD, 
            abi.encode(5000, true)          // Price > $5000
        )
    })
];
```

## Technical Architecture: Seamless Integration

### 🔄 **Zero Breaking Changes**
- Existing DevKit commands work unchanged
- Current task-based AVS continue operating  
- WorkflowStateMachine deploys as a custom contract
- Backward compatibility maintained

### 🏗️ **Clean Extension Pattern**
```bash
# Standard DevKit workflow remains identical
devkit avs init
devkit avs build  
devkit avs devnet start

# WorkflowStateMachine automatically deployed via DeployMyContracts.s.sol
# Performers automatically handle both tasks AND workflow phases
```

### 🔌 **Performer Auto-Detection**
The enhanced performer automatically detects and routes execution:

```go
func (tw *TaskWorker) HandleTask(t *performerV1.TaskRequest) (*performerV1.TaskResponse, error) {
    // Auto-detect workflow vs. regular task
    var workflowTask WorkflowTask
    if err := json.Unmarshal(t.Payload, &workflowTask); err == nil {
        // Route to workflow-specific handler
        return tw.handleWorkflowTask(t.TaskId, &workflowTask)
    }
    
    // Handle regular task (existing logic unchanged)
    return tw.handleRegularTask(t)
}
```

### 📊 **Intelligent State Management**
- Cross-phase data dependencies resolved automatically
- Timeout handling with graceful failure modes
- Economic incentives preserved (fees, slashing)
- Access control and authorization maintained
